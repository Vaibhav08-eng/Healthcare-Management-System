# Online Healthcare Management System

A desktop-based healthcare management system built using Java Swing and MySQL. The application follows a clean MVC + DAO + Service architecture and supports three user roles: **Admin**, **Doctor**, and **Patient** — each with their own dashboards and workflows.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Java 8+
- Swing (desktop UI)
- MySQL 8.x
- JDBC (mysql-connector-j)
- MVC + DAO + Service multi-layer architecture
- SHA-256 password hashing

---

## 📌 Core Features

### 1. Authentication & Roles
- Secure login with SHA-256 password hashing
- Separate dashboards for Admin, Doctor, and Patient
- Role-based access control enforced at UI & service layers

### 2. Admin Portal
- Manage doctors and patients (add / update / remove)
- Manage system settings (key/value store)
- View appointment statistics & system analytics
- Full visibility into system operations

### 3. Doctor Portal
- Manage personal availability slots
- View upcoming appointments
- Access/update patient medical records
- View patient feedback & average ratings

### 4. Patient Portal
- Book, cancel, or reschedule appointments
- View personal medical history
- Submit ratings and feedback for doctors

### 5. Internal Logic & Validation
- Appointment conflict detection
- Input validation on all forms
- Centralized dialog & date utilities
- Extensible service layer for business rules

## 🗄 Database Setup
- Install MySQL 8.x
- Open MySQL Workbench
### Run:
- SOURCE sql/healthcare_db.sql;
#### This creates:
- ->The database & tables
- ->Seeded data (Admin, Doctor, Patient accounts)
## Default Login
- Role Email Password
- Admin admin@health.com admin123
## ▶️ Running the Application
- 1.Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse
- 2.Add the MySQL connector:
- ->Place mysql-connector-j.jar inside lib/
- ->Add it to your project/module dependencies
- 3.Update DB credentials in:
- src/com/healthcare/dao/ConnectionFactory.java
- 4.Build and run:
- com.healthcare.ui.LoginFrame
- 5.Log in using the seeded accounts
## 🧱 Architecture Overview
### *Model Layer
- Contains basic data objects used by DAOs and services.
### *DAO Layer
- Responsible for all database interactions using JDBC.
- No SQL logic is mixed into UI components.
### *Service Layer
 Handles business rules:
- ->Appointment slot conflict checks
- ->User validation
- ->Role-specific operations
### *UI Layer (Swing)
- Screens invoke services — never DAOs directly.
- Separation ensures cleaner, maintainable code.
## 📊 Analytics
The system includes a lightweight analytics module (ReportService), providing:
- ->Total users
- ->Doctor count
- ->Appointment summaries
- ->Basic trends
No external analytics libraries required.
## 🚀 Why This Project Matters
- ->Uses real industry patterns (MVC, DAO, service abstraction)
- ->Clean separation of concerns
- ->Expandable dashboards for three different user types
- ->Strong foundation for academic, portfolio, or internship submissions
